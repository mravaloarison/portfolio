title: I Treated AI Like It Could Think
date: 2026-02-08
description: Like many developers in my era, I started coding with AI believing I could build almost anything with it - apps, websites, systems I barely understood. The problem was, I didn’t understand what “it” actually was.

In late 2022, OpenAI launched <a href="https://chat.openai.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>, and it quickly became one of the most talked-about technologies of the decade. You could ask it almost anything, and it would respond with something that sounded informed and confident. It felt reasonable to assume that if it could explain things so well, it could also think through tasks for you. And to some extent, it actually can.

I remember using it for the first time to debug some Python code. I was blown away because not only did it give me answers, but it also suggested refinements I could try, and they surprisingly worked. The usual process would have been searching through <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> threads or piecing together answers from random blog posts. Instead, everything was delivered to me on a plate after a single prompt. I started relying on it to write small blocks of code, then full functions, and eventually entire files.

I then began thinking I could use it to learn mobile development and build more apps, skipping all the tutorials and documentation. Instead of reading and understanding the fundamentals, I would just describe what I wanted and start building from there. I assumed that because I had a strong background in web development, it wouldn’t be that difficult to transition. I thought I could simply ask the model to translate my web development concepts into iOS terms.

That was my first real disappointment. I followed the instructions carefully. But it didn’t work. At first, I thought: “Yeah, it makes mistakes sometimes. I’ll just paste the error message and ask what’s wrong. That had worked before.” A few hours passed, and I was still stuck. I was frustrated because, unlike Python or JavaScript, I didn’t understand anything about what was happening. I had skipped the part where I was supposed to learn how iOS development actually worked. I told myself I would have to learn it properly and maybe come back to AI later for debugging.

My second disappointment wasn’t long ago. When I first discovered <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, I decided to use it to build my portfolio. It seemed very much like a “work smart, not hard” approach. I found the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio" target="_blank">al-folio</a> template, customized it, and everything looked fine locally. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript edits worked without issues. I followed the <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> deployment instructions in the README, and everything seemed smooth. But once it went live, the styling and JavaScript broke.

So I went to AI to debug it. I spent about five hours trying three different models. Each suggestion led to more changes. Each change led to more issues. Eventually, I had to revert everything, and I told myself, “Maybe I just have to stop being lazy and go through the documentation, learn how Jekyll actually works.”

Looking back, I think I missed the whole point of AI. At the end of the day, these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">large language models</a>. They aren’t meant to think; they just generate. You still need a minimum level of understanding to prompt properly, judge results, and know what to change.

Now, I’ve come to see AI more as a tool that amplifies what I already understand rather than something that can do the thinking for me. It simplifies tasks and accelerates work, but it doesn’t remove the need to know what you’re doing.

I still use AI, and I’m still learning how to use it better. Maybe in the near future it will evolve far beyond what it is today. But for now, this is where it stands for me.
