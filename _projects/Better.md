    Better is a betting app we built during HackPrinceton, where we won Best Use of the Knot API. Knot is an API that allows developers to connect users to merchants everywhere. I was paired with three other developers, and I worked on the iOS version of the app, implementing the API to track users’ purchases from merchants they liked.
