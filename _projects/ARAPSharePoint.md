    The Office of ARAP needed a SharePoint site to showcase the work of its different departments. I was assigned to create templates so they could provide content later, and I currently maintain the site as well.

Besides my data analytics work, I also built and maintained a SharePoint site for the ARAP Office. I wasn’t exposed to SharePoint until I started the project, but it was easy to pick up since it mainly involved drag-and-drop components. There were also ways to inject a few lines of code or use README-style formatting to customize certain sections.

I’m glad I had this project because it gave me more exposure to Microsoft tools used in the business environment. I still update the site from time to time whenever they send new content or requests.
