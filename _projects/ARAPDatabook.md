I was offered a Junior Data Analyst position at Monroe University before I graduated in June 2025. I officially started in July 2025 and am currently still in the role. At the time, I didn’t fully understand what the position would involve, since my background was primarily in software development.

I didn’t start immediately after graduation because I was waiting for my EAD card. When I finally began in July, I found the work surprisingly enjoyable. I liked seeing data visualized in dashboards, even though I didn’t fully understand what everything represented at first. It simply looked interesting to me.

I currently work under a Senior Data Scientist who builds reports and dashboards for the school. She introduced me to Power BI and taught me how dashboards should be structured, and I’ve been learning from there. One of my main ongoing projects is migrating the school’s printed DataBook into Power BI by recreating and refining over 100 dashboards.

Due to the confidential nature of the data, I’m unable to share specific examples publicly.
