The concept was to save learners time and maximize learning from video content. The platform extracts key concepts from videos, summarizes lessons, and delivers important points through spaced-repetition text messages. It also generates quizzes based on the material to reinforce knowledge retention.

Users begin by logging in with email and password or their Google account. They then paste a video link on the homepage to get started. In the background, an AI system evaluates whether the video is educational and extracts meaningful lesson points. Once relevant content is identified, the system generates simplified explanations and related quizzes.

Key facts are sent to users via text messages after they provide their phone number. These messages follow a spaced-repetition schedule to improve retention, while quizzes appear in a dedicated section so users can test their understanding later.
