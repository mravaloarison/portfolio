title: Portfolio 1.0
description: >
    This was my first portfolio design. I built it in a rush, and the content wasn’t fully ready, nor was the design fully thought through. Because I was graduating, I felt pressured to have one before finishing school. It was built with Next.js, Material UI for design to save time and GSAP for animation and hosted on Vercel.

Before graduating, I had already won all my hackathons and knew it was time to start applying for jobs, like a “welcome to the real world” moment. But I didn’t have a platform to showcase my work or introduce who I was. At the same time, I was dealing with paperwork and deadlines, which made everything feel rushed.

So I quickly built a portfolio, with a lot of help from AI, just to get something up and running as soon as possible. That’s how my first portfolio came together. Even though I don’t use it anymore to display my work, I’ve kept it online so I can look back at it someday. It’s honestly a really nice memory.

I built it with Next.js, Material UI, and GSAP, and hosted it on Vercel because they were fast to work with and easy to set up.
