title: Portfolio 1.0
description: >
    This was my first portfolio design. I built it in a rush, and the content wasn’t fully ready, nor was the design fully thought through. Because I was graduating, I felt pressured to have one before finishing school. It was built with Next.js, Material UI for design to save time and GSAP for animation and hosted on Vercel.
