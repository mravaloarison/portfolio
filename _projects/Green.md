    An iOS app designed to reduce traffic emissions. This was a solo hack where I explored MVVM architecture, MapKit, Swift, and SwiftUI. I used MapKit to redirect users to routes with less traffic, helping reduce vehicle emissions.

"Green" is an app built to reduce traffic emissions by helping drivers find routes with minimal stops as possible. It analyzes current traffic for a route and dynamically recommends routes that avoid traffic hotspots, ensuring drivers spend less time in traffic even though, now the travel time has increased. Every time a user completes a route with fewer emissions, they earn points. These points can then be redeemed for discounts or rewards offered by environmentally conscious companies, such as WWF, National Geographic, and others dedicated to environmental causes.

I used Swift, SwiftUI, and MapKit.
